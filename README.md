## Udacity Linux Workspace
[Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) provides a browser-based Linux [Workspace](https://engineering.udacity.com/creating-a-gpu-enhanced-virtual-desktop-for-udacity-497bdd91a505) for students. 

You are welcome to develop this project on your local machine, and you are not required to use the Udacity Workspace. However, the Workspace provides a convenient and consistent Linux development environment we encourage you to try.
